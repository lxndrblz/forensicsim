The following code is heavily adopted from the RawLevelDb and IndexedDB processing proposed by CCL Group

https://github.com/cclgroupltd/ccl_chrome_indexeddb/blob/35b6a9efba1078cf339f9e64d2796b1f5f7c556f/ccl_chromium_indexeddb.py

It uses an optimized enumeration approach for processing the metadata, which makes the original IndexedDB super slow.

Additionally, it has a flag to filter for datastores, which are interesting for us.
